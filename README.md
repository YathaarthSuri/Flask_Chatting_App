# Flask_Chatting_App
Chatting web app using Flask.

This has been created using HTML and JavaScript for front-end and Python for back-end.

I have used Socket.io for this app.

This app sends messages to another user who has opened the link and anyone with link can see messages if they opened at the same time.

It does not store messages once refreshed.

App has been deployed using Heroku.
